While reading the book「 The Elements of Skill--a conscious approach to learning」, the author's opinion on learning resonates with me and got me thinking.

> We discover that learning is experiential, that we aren't imposing something but undergoing an experience--evaluating，reforming and rethinking. Ultimately this process leads to greater control and an enhanced sense of **appreciation, humility and self-knowledge.**
> 
> In short, it leads to **internal development, insight and even the building of character.**

I somehow started to see a vague image of the author Dr. Theodore Dimon, full of humility and humanity. Knowing this simple reality that somewhere in this planet, people like him are devoting themselves to studying 「 human behavior, such as learning」, is itself comforting and inspiring. And today, I am going to elaborate a little bit on the topic of how to learn. I will try not to be confined by this single book I mentioned above, but also add into account some other relevant books and theories. Yet, if not otherwise stated explicitly, 「 the book」and「 the author」hereunder refer to 「 The Elements of Skill--a conscious approach to learning」and its author Theodore Dimon.

We are constantly learning and involving, and we shall be conscious of how we do certain things, to gain insight into not only those particular procedures but also ourselves, a rare occurrence and intelligent species「 in terms of our current knowledge of course, as there are possibilities that we may find other species that are far more intelligent and almighty or whatever than our human beings.」

As for me, one who survived our current education system with a not-too-bad result, I have long known sentences like「 the development of things depend fundamentally on internal causes and external causes become operative through internal causes 」in their general and philosophical senses. I do know the importance of cultivating true interests in things that I want to do well, and as in this passage, 「things」refer to 「learning」in particular. But I do have missed something really important, which I will explain later.

Sayings concerning learning or the importance of learning are too often said and heard that they become cliche and we are not able to read between the lines, and get what's really behind them. And an unneglectable reality is that, due to some bad teaching and/or unpleasant personal experiences, learning and studying have long been deemed by many as painstaking or even tedious, and under many circumstances, in vain. 

This book, however, is a good start for us to rethink「learning」, as it might help you discover why some of the teaching methods are wrong, and how we fail to achieve the 「ends」that we strive for even with so many painstaking efforts. It redirects our attention to ourselves and the 「means」we take, away from the 「ends」. WE are supposed to be **the active and conscious part** in the learning process. And how? Read on, please. 

We might first get a glimpse of the essence of this book. 

> 「 He」 emphasizes **informed and intelligent efforts** to balance the respective roles of 「means」and「ends」within the learning process. 
> 
> Ends-in-view must be neither inflexible nor vague, the means to those ends must undergo continual re-adjustment in the light of emerging conditions.
> 
> He wants to teach us how we can learn to learn.

「 Means」, as the emphasis of this book, are explained in a logical and detailed manner. And they are actually 「 forward-looking and preventive in nature, rather than simply curative and remedial」.

Aiming at fundamental changes instead of mere treatment of symptoms in people's learning behavior, the author identifies the problem of learning skills and provides with respective countermeasures.

#### Components of Learning Problem

* We seldom question the common idea that we must try to perfect our actions while learning a skill;

* We try too hard to discover the various elements that make up a skill.

#### Components of Learning a Skill

* break it down into manageable parts

* make the process of learning more conscious by gaining an improved control over action

> The one element underlying all skills is the self--the functioning mind and body--as the central instrumentality upon which all learning depends. 

Thus the author introduces to us an entirely new approach to learning: **by intelligence mastery of the self.**

This reminds me of the intelligence theory of Dr.Perkins. He listed three kinds of intelligence, namely:

* Neural Intelligence: one that is born with us, highly dependent on that of parents at first, yet can be developed and enhanced at the early stage;

* Experiential Intelligence: accumulated knowledge and experience, which enable people to perform well/expertly in their particular fields as time goes by;

* Reflective Intelligence: ability to use and manipulate the mental skills; thinking strategies that effectively utilize our neural and experiential intelligence. This includes self-monitoring and self-management. 

As you might have find out, I am thinking about the 「Reflective Intelligence」. 

Dr. Wei Kunlin concluded in a speech concerning developing children‘s intelligence, he himself thinks that, real intelligence = (Neural Intelligence + Experiential Intelligence) * Reflective Intelligence. He is sending out the same message as our author here: developing the consciousness and awareness of the learner, to monitor and manage one's thinking and actioning, and make changes to those faulty modes, is the ultimate solution to learning problems and might result in a better version of the learner「 to better understand this, you can regard this as the same old device with an upgraded operating system and enhanced hardware」

OK, I agree that theories are easier said than done, otherwise, we won't be witnessing so many failures in ourselves and in people around us.

Talking about failures, what are the main reasons that people fail to do things, and in this case, fail to learn? Reasons might be as follows: 

* we deny ourselves the opportunity to learn something new

* we change the rules of the game in midstream 「 creating new goals midstream while the former ones unresolved」

* negativity and learned helplessness

> We harbor a secret conviction that we cannot learn and are therefore half-hearted in our attempts. When we fail, we are secretly satisfied that we have proven ourselves right.

How very strange of our human beings?! We somehow create setbacks for ourselves while we learn, consciously or unconsciously. We might all have been in such situations: people saying that they will never learn to do something, and students might complain that some subjects are just too difficult to learn, so on and so forth.

The problem is, this kind of behaviors, and the emotional difficulties themselves are what make it impossible to learn. 

It then occurs to me that I read from a book named *Pragmatic Thinking and Learning*「 PTL for short hereunder」a theory named **Neural Plasticity.** 

* the amount of skills and knowledge that you are able to acquire is not limited;

* leaners believing in the plasticity of their brains can improve comparatively easier;

* the skills you use constantly become dominant and this leads to more connections within your brain; skills less used sometimes lose their ground unless they have already been internalized and become tacit knowledge.

And the same chapter there in *PTL* about knowing our brain says positive emotions are critical to learning and creative thinking. Being happy and motivated can expand your thinking and activate more materials in your brain, while anger and fear prevent the brain from providing more materials, for the preparation of fight or flight. 

That's how our brain works. And sadly, not many of us are seeing this. 

> Learning something new always involves thinking in a new way, forming new conceptions about what we are doing and how we do it. 

Before going into the details of Dimon's suggested approaches, let's first get ourselves familiar with his opinion of skilled actions:

* the reflex component
* the voluntary component

> The execution of the correct act are comprised of reflexive actions as well as voluntary actions.
> 
> What makes these skills complex, is not the addition of deliberate action, but the ability to **conceive** of complex movements and to **coordinate** them one after the other while **not interfering with** the natural reflexive functions upon which the specific actions are based. 
> 
> Learning involves what we must not do as well as what we must.

* Perception
* Attention
* Eye-hand coordination
* Kinesthetic Awareness
* The Coordinating Function of Thought

> Skilled actions result from a number of perceptual and receptive components that must be coordinated with overt actions to produce the completed movements.
> 
> Skilled actions are often skilled not by virtue of what we *do* to make them happen but **adjustments** that we make in response to our perceptions. 

Traditionally, while learning, our energy is focused on what we are trying to do and what we want to achieve, thus we lose sight of and even undermining the efforts of the person, who is actually making this learn process happen, and the overall system, a bigger picture. 

The right thing to do is not to be obsessed with the idea of **doing things right**, but understand *how* we do things, and consciously break it down to manageable parts. We can try by indirect and experimental approach to overcome the wrong conception in a safe environment, where we might also stop and consciously see what we are doing without regarding it *as* wrong, as knowing something is wrong is different from knowing what is actually going wrong.

> The difficulty is not simply in doing what has to be done, but in knowing what needs to happen, that is, a clear conception of the task at hand.

We need to discover the true problem that requires our **attention**. As sometimes, our actions are more a result of our habitual and faulty pattern, if we, not knowing this, allow ourselves go further in that direction and drilling ourselves, hoping that「 practice makes perfect」, we are actually wrongly enhancing that harmful behavior.

There are many preset pathways within our brain, and not knowing other choices means no more options. Our brain very conveniently pick the preset pathway without even considering it. 

> An understanding of habit equips the student to address impeding obstacles and ensures continued growth and development.
> 
> Ultimately, it gives the student a conscious command over the essential instrumentality upon which all learning depends--the self.

Our goal is to be more conscious about ourselves, the relations between our mind and our body, the organization and connections within our brain, the default mode as well as the possibilities of our own thinking and actioning. 

> When skill involves an intelligent working out of means and ends, the process becomes educational in the truest sense of the word, leading not only to improved mastery of the specific skill, but ultimately to self-mastery.

***

A bonus for those who have read this far: a magical thing called *Growth Mindset* by Carol Dweck, who writes:

> In a growth mindset, people believe that their most basic abilities can be developed through dedication and hard work—brains and talent are just the starting point. This view creates a love of learning and a resilience that is essential for great accomplishment,” 
> 
> Students who embrace growth mindsets, learn it more quickly, and view challenges and failures as opportunities to improve their learning and skills.

Most importantly, this kind of growth mindset can be developed and it will contribute to your learning process. 

To learn, or not to learn, is your choice.

Mistakes above are all mine。

Thanks for reading!

Note: This book focuses on skills in performing arts and sports that require body movements and things like that. It's not solely written for the purpose of mental development.
