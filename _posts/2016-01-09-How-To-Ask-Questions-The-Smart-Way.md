写在前面

关于不聪明、关于懒惰、关于无知，皆然。

这是已经讨论过的话题，我当时以及现在也都深切地明白那段话“日常的生活，更多的是精力的均衡分配。效率的低下，很大一部分原因就在于，把太多的精力和时间浪费在了那些压根不需要、不应该牵扯的地方。但的确没办法，处理不好，就只有受牵连。受牵连就只有进入一个怪圈里。人的精力实际上非常有限，如果在一个地方被消耗了 很容易就导致另外的 真正要着力的地方会后继无力。”

但一次又一次并非本意地带人跌入深坑，耗时耗力，让人觉得心累，感觉屡教不改。原因无它，也就是上面的懒惰、无知、不聪明，还有，应该就是积习难改，改变速度没有跟上来。

今天早上朋友推荐的一篇文章，里面说到「迟钝，既不美，也不善」，以为然。我看到作者另一篇文章里一个很有趣的题目「The curse of the gifted」，里面有这样一段话 「We learned the hard way that the bill always comes due -- the scale of the problems always increases to a point where your native talent alone doesn't cut it any more.  The smarter you are, the longer it takes to hit that crunch point -- and the harder the adjustment when you finally do.  And we can see that *you*, poor damn genius that you are, are cruising for a serious bruising」。

我自然不是 talented nor genius，却也陷入那样一个怪圈。文中说到 「It's a common trap」, and I guess I have not learned how to study yet. 

说回最近的实际问题以及可能的原因。

或许已经是一种 Pattern，因为在开始真正的技能学习前，其实有过许多的无关的、发散的 chat，而非现在主题式的讨论和研究。思想转变不及时，还停留在过去，也就导致了还会常有原来那样的非结果导向的过程中的离题的闲散信息。

或许我一直处于懒散的状态，以往的学习也好，工作也罢，常常时间节点并不着急。我会在战略上重视，但行动上，节奏通常并不会特别快。涉及团队合作，涉及明确时间节点的部分，我自会保证时间在那之前完成，大环境允许的情况下，可能提前完成也不一定。也是一个很矛盾的性格，在别无他法的情况下，自己也能想到一切可想到的办法，努力去完成一些东西，结果自是不会尽善尽美。而性格里不会主动去攻克难题的部分，其实也让我一直没有撞到真正的「南墙」。一旦碰上了真实的挑战，各种问题便开始显现，不会提问，不懂正确地互动，心里知道要尊重并节省对方的时间，可又往往事与愿违。

认真想想，我做了许许多多令人费解的事情，也都非出于本心。出于无知，很多事情意识不到其重要性；出于懒惰，许多该留下记录的东西也都放任其过去，当然，这和之前对自己记忆力的错误估计也有关系；而所有这些，到后来也就导致了自己和他人一系列的麻烦，虽然不是出自主观意愿，却也是害人害己。「凡事预则立，不预则废」，这是很久前看过的一句话，但我，或许始终没有抓住它的精神实质。想来，不管是自己的事情，还是涉及他人的工作，自己事先有所准备，才能有更好的效果。通畅的沟通，也万万不能少。

今晨，老板发来信息询问日程和车票事宜，告知了他解决方法，并提醒他改签后通知我，我去做下一步安排。分了两句话发出，受到误解。转念一想，其间的逻辑关系在我看来不言自明，在他人看来，却或许已经是另一层意思。

关于我语言的含糊性，其实早有感悟。作为日常聊天中的 natural flow，我是觉得大部分时候，说话双方是能够理解对方的所言。但实际情况是，需要我们一步到位，从别人的角度出发，而非主观臆断，乃至期盼对方能够仅凭一两个聊天过程中用过的词汇，想到你所有的联想。比如，若我能在日常对话里，打起十二分精神，用平日里记录文档的 precision & consideration，那造成的误解要少得多。

也不是说在工作中还完全没养成好的习惯，也不是语言和文字表达确实有多差，会议备忘，说不上是老板客气，还是确实写得还不错，每几次里也都会有一两次受到表扬。之前和第三方机构联系，处理一件比较棘手的问题，在我看来已经应该有流程中的规范文档，也是在我反复提问中，对方给了我一份不甚明确地还含有错别字的 Word 文件，当然，这也说明之前我的问题并不齐备，提问或许也不到点上。针对文件，考虑到那以外可能碰到的问题，我进行了新一轮提问，开始自己组织语言修改文档，而后与之确认。后来那位姑娘和我说，你工作好认真哦。当然，这其间，如此往复，时间也是耗费了不少。

所以，说回到提问这门技术活儿。今天一大早 收到链接 [ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way)，按图索骥去找了它的source，也就是这篇文章 [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/~esr/faqs/smart-questions.html) by Eric Steven Raymond


简明扼要的观点，应该是

1. （在论坛等）提问前
   * 相关领域内网站、论坛，万维网上的搜索
   * 相关产品的 手册，FAQ
   * 自己尝试、验证
   * ask more skilled personnel
   * 检查源码 用一些诊断程序进行检测
2. 提问时
   * 选择正确的论坛 和水平等级 （这句用于论坛提问，以下的提问 不仅在技术中，其实也适用于生活其他方面）
   * 描述准确 「目标与差异」式的描述
   * 描述问题发生环境 按时间说明症状表现 
   * 你做过的尝试 「近期的软硬件更改/环境改变」
   * 一个可以复制该问题的环境的方法
   * 想清楚对方可能问你什么 在它提问前先提供这些信息
   * 不要做错误的假设，这样可能干扰对方的思考方向 「描述症状 原始证据 而非猜测」
   * 描述目标，不要说自己想用 A 达到 B，告知目标是 B，现在卡在 A点，对方可能有更好的关于工具选择或方法的建议。
   * 清楚表达问题及需求 「需要检查代码 补丁 提供指点等」
   * 去掉无意义的提问句 can anyone/you help etc.
   * 礼多人不怪 （这一点 真心分人...）
   * 问题解决后 补充说明解决方法 「而后可以加上避免调入坑里的一些注意事项」

以下为部分内容摘要，中文繁体版翻译见 [这里](https://github.com/ryanhanwu/How-To-Ask-Questions-The-Smart-Way)

##Introduction
hackers have a reputation for meeting simple questions with what looks like hostility or arrogance. 

What we are, unapologetically, is hostile to people who seem to be unwilling to think or to do their own homework before asking questions. 

they take without giving back, and they waste time we could have spent on another question more interesting and another person more worthy of an answer. We call people like this “losers”

our style of answering questions is tuned for people who do take such an interest and are willing to be active participants in problem-solving. That's not going to change. Nor should it; if it did, we would become less effective at the things we do best.

most of us would love nothing more than to deal with you as an equal and welcome you into our culture, if you put in the effort required to make that possible. But it's simply not efficient for us to try to help people who are not willing to help themselves. It's OK to be ignorant; it's not OK to play stupid.

t is necessary to demonstrate the kind of attitude that leads to competence — alert, thoughtful, observant, willing to be an active partner in developing a solution. If you can't live with this sort of discrimination, we suggest you pay somebody for a commercial support contract instead of asking hackers to personally donate help to you.

The best way to get a rapid and responsive answer is to ask it like a person with smarts, confidence, and clues who just happens to need help on one particular problem. 

##Before You Ask
try to find an answer by doing the following: 

1. by searching the archives of the forum or mailing list you plan to post to.

2. by searching the Web.

3. by reading the manual.

4. by reading a FAQ.

5. by inspection or experimentation.

6. by asking a skilled friend.

7. If you're a programmer, by reading the source code.

When you ask your question, display what you have learned from doing these things. We like answering questions for people who have demonstrated they can learn from the answers.

Use tactics like doing a Google search on the text of whatever error message you get (searching Google groups as well as Web pages). This might well take you straight to fix documentation or a mailing list thread answering your question. 

Do not expect to be able to solve a complicated problem with a few seconds of Googling. Read and understand the FAQs, sit back, relax and give the problem some thought before approaching experts. 

Prepare your question. Think it through. The more you do to demonstrate that having put thought and effort into solving your problem before seeking help, the more likely you are to actually get help.

Beware of asking the wrong question. give no faulty assumptions，or the experience of getting what you asked for rather than what you needed will teach you a lesson.

Never assume you are entitled to an answer. You will earn an answer, if you earn it, by asking a substantial, interesting, and thought-provoking question — one that implicitly contributes to the experience of the community rather than merely passively demanding knowledge from others.

On the other hand, making it clear that you are able and willing to help in the process of developing the solution is a very good start. “Would someone provide a pointer?”, “What is my example missing?”, and “What site should I have checked?” are more likely to get answered than “Please post the exact procedure I should use.” because you're making it clear that you're truly willing to complete the process if someone can just point you in the right direction.

##When You Ask
###Choose your forum carefully

Not to do:

1. where it's off topic
2. inappropriate concerning the levels
3. cross-post to too many different newsgroups
4. post a personal e-mail to somebody who is neither an acquaintance of yours nor personally responsible for solving your problem

Hackers blow off questions that are inappropriately targeted in order to try to protect their communications channels from being drowned in irrelevance. 

The first step, therefore, is to find the right forum. Again, Google and other Web-searching methods are your friend.  the project webpage most closely associated, lnks to FAQ list, and to project mailing lists and their archives.  

Shooting off an e-mail to a person or forum which you are not familiar with is risky at best.

When selecting a Web forum, newsgroup or mailing list, don't trust the name by itself too far; look for a FAQ or charter to verify your question is on-topic. Read some of the back traffic before posting so you'll get a feel for how things are done there. In fact, it's a very good idea to do a keyword search for words relating to your problem on the newsgroup or mailing list archives before you post. It may find you an answer, and if not it will help you formulate a better question.


Know what your topic is! 

questions to a well-selected public forum are more likely to get useful answers than equivalent questions to a private one.

Understandably, skilled hackers and authors of popular software are already receiving more than their fair share of mis-targeted messages. By adding to the flood, you could in extreme cases even be the straw that breaks the camel's back — quite a few times, contributors to popular projects have withdrawn their support because collateral damage in the form of useless e-mail traffic to their personal accounts became unbearable.

##Stack Overflow
###Search, then ask on Stack Exchange
Start with a Google search before looking at Stack Exchange; 

If you didn't find anything through Google, search again on the specific site most relevant to your question (see below). Searching with tags can help narrow down the results.

post your question on the one site where it's most on-topic. Use the formatting tools, especially for code, and add tags that are related to the substance of your question (particularly the name of the programming language, operating system, or library you're having trouble with). If a commenter asks you for more information, edit your main post to include it. 

###Web and IRC forums
Before posting to any Web forum, check if it has a Search feature. If it does, try a couple of keyword searches for something like your problem; it just might help. If you did a general Web search before (as you should have), search the forum anyway; your Web-wide search engine might not have all of this forum indexed recently.

###As a second step, use project mailing lists
Any question good enough to be asked of one developer will also be of value to the whole group. Contrariwise, if you suspect your question is too dumb for a mailing list, it's not an excuse to harass individual developers.

If certain questions are seen to be asked often, developers can use that information to improve the documentation or the software itself to be less confusing. But if those questions are asked in private, nobody has the complete picture of what questions are asked most often.

###Use meaningful, specific subject headers

the subject header is your golden opportunity to attract qualified experts' attention in around 50 characters or fewer. use the space for a super-concise problem description 

is “object - deviation”. The “object” part specifies what thing or group of things is having a problem, and the “deviation” part describes the deviation from expected behavior.

Stupid:
HELP! Video doesn't work properly on my laptop!

Smart:
X.org 6.8.1 misshapen mouse cursor, Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset

Smarter:
X.org 6.8.1 mouse cursor on Fooware MV1005 vid. chipset - is misshapen

Make your subject line reflect your question well enough that the next person searching the archive with a question similar to yours will be able to follow the thread to an answer rather than posting the question again.

###Make it easy to reply
In Web forums, asking for a reply by e-mail is outright rude, If you want an e-mail copy when somebody replies in the thread, request that the Web forum send it; this feature is supported almost everywhere under options like “watch this thread”, “send e-mail on answers”, etc.

###Write in clear, grammatical, correctly-spelled language
We've found by experience that people who are careless and sloppy writers are usually also careless and sloppy at thinking and coding (often enough to bet on, anyway). Answering questions for careless and sloppy thinkers is not rewarding; we'd rather spend our time elsewhere.

Spend the extra effort to polish your language. It doesn't have to be stiff or formal — in fact, hacker culture values informal, slangy and humorous language used with precision. But it has to be precise; there has to be some indication that you're thinking and paying attention.

If you are writing in English but it is a second language for you, it is good form to alert potential respondents to potential language difficulties and options for getting around them. Examples:

English is not my native language; please excuse typing errors.

If you speak $LANGUAGE, please email/PM me; I may need assistance translating my question.

I am familiar with the technical terms, but some slang expressions and idioms are difficult for me.

I've posted my question in $LANGUAGE and English. I'll be glad to translate responses, if you only use one or the other.

###Send questions in accessible, standard formats

###Be precise and informative about your problem

1. Describe the symptoms of your problem or bug carefully and clearly.

2. Describe the environment in which it occurs (machine, OS, application, whatever). Provide your vendor's distribution and release level (e.g.: “Fedora Core 7”, “Slackware 9.1”, etc.).

3. Describe the research you did to try and understand the problem before you asked the question.

4. Describe the diagnostic steps you took to try and pin down the problem yourself before you asked the question.

5. Describe any possibly relevant recent changes in your computer or software configuration.

6. If at all possible, provide a way to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment.

Do the best you can to anticipate the questions a hacker will ask, and answer them in advance in your request for help.

Giving hackers the ability to reproduce the problem in a controlled environment is especially important if you are reporting something you think is a bug in code. When you do this, your odds of getting a useful answer and the speed with which you are likely to get that answer both improve tremendously.

Simon Tatham has written an excellent essay entitled How to Report Bugs Effectively. I strongly recommend that you read it. [How to Report Bugs Effectively](http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/bugs.html)

###Volume is not precision
You need to be precise and informative. This end is not served by simply dumping huge volumes of code or data into a help request. If you have a large, complicated test case that is breaking a program, try to trim it and make it as small as possible.

This is useful for at least three reasons. One: being seen to invest effort in simplifying the question makes it more likely you'll get an answer, Two: simplifying the question makes it more likely you'll get a useful answer. Three: In the process of refining your bug report, you may develop a fix or workaround yourself.

###Don't rush to claim that you have found a bug
When you are having problems with a piece of software, don't claim you have found a bug unless you are very, very sure of your ground. 

The people who wrote the software work very hard to make it work as well as possible. If you claim you have found a bug, you'll be impugning their competence, which may offend some of them even if you are correct. It's especially undiplomatic to yell “bug” in the Subject line.

###Grovelling is not a substitute for doing your homework

Don't waste your time, or ours, on crude primate politics. Instead, present the background facts and your question as clearly as you can. That is a better way to position yourself than by grovelling.

###Describe the problem's symptoms, not your guesses
make sure you're telling them the raw symptoms of what goes wrong, rather than your interpretations and theories. Let them do the interpretation and diagnosis. If you feel it's important to state your guess, clearly label it as such and describe why that answer isn't working for you.

frothy eloquence neither convinces nor satisfies me. I'm from Missouri. You've got to show me.") In diagnosticians' case, it's not a matter of skepticism, but rather a literal, functional need to see whatever is as close as possible to the same raw evidence that you see, rather than your surmises and summaries. Show us.

###Describe your problem's symptoms in chronological order
The clues most useful in figuring out something that went wrong often lie in the events immediately prior. So, your account should describe precisely what you did, and what the machine and software did, leading up to the blowup. In the case of command-line processes, having a session log (e.g., using the script utility) and quoting the relevant twenty or so lines is very useful.

###Describe the goal, not the step
people who need technical help have a high-level goal in mind and get stuck on what they think is one particular path towards the goal. They come for help with the step, but don't realize that the path is wrong. It can take substantial effort to get past this.

###Don't ask people to reply by private e-mail
###Be explicit about your question
You are more likely to get a useful response if you are explicit about what you want respondents to do (provide pointers, send code, check your patch, whatever). This will focus their effort and implicitly put an upper bound on the time and energy a respondent must allocate to helping you. This is good.

To understand the world the experts live in, think of expertise as an abundant resource and time to respond as a scarce one. The less of a time commitment you implicitly ask for, the more likely you are to get an answer from someone really good and really busy.

###When asking about code
Don't ask others to debug your broken code without giving a hint what sort of problem they should be searching for. 

Posting a few hundred lines of code, saying "it doesn't work", will get you ignored. Posting a dozen lines of code, saying "after line 7 I was expecting to see <x>, but <y> occurred instead" is much more likely to get you a response.

The most effective way to be precise about a code problem is to provide a minimal bug-demonstrating test case. What's a minimal test case? It's an illustration of the problem; just enough code to exhibit the undesirable behavior and no more. How do you make a minimal test case? If you know what line or section of code is producing the problematic behavior, make a copy of it and add just enough supporting code to produce a complete example

###Don't post homework questions

Those questions are for you to work out, so that you will learn from the experience. It is OK to ask for hints, but not for entire solutions.

###Prune pointless queries
say no to “can anyone help me”，“is there an answer” or things like that

###Don't flag your question as “Urgent”, even if it is for you
Claiming urgency is very likely to be counter-productive: most hackers will simply delete such messages as rude and selfish attempts to elicit immediate and special attention.

###Courtesy never hurts, and sometimes helps
Make it clear you appreciate the time people spend helping you for free.

being grammatical, clear, precise and descriptive, avoiding proprietary formats etc.; hackers in general would rather get somewhat brusque but technically sharp bug reports than polite vagueness. (If this puzzles you, remember that we value a question by what it teaches us.)

###Follow up with a brief note on the solution
Optimally, the reply should be to the thread started by the original question posting, and should have ‘FIXED’, ‘RESOLVED’ or an equally obvious tag in the subject line. 

n fact, a short and sweet summary is better than a long dissertation unless the solution has real technical depth. Say what action solved the problem, but you need not replay the whole troubleshooting sequence.

For problems with some depth, it is appropriate to post a summary of the troubleshooting history. Describe your final problem statement. Describe what worked as a solution, and indicate avoidable blind alleys *after* that. The blind alleys should come after the correct solution and other summary material, rather than turning the follow-up into a detective story. Name the names of people who helped you; you'll make friends that way.

Last, and not least, this sort of followup helps everybody who assisted feel a satisfying sense of closure about the problem.

Among hackers, this sort of good followup behavior is actually more important than conventional politeness. It's how you get a reputation for playing well with others, which can be a very valuable asset.

##How To Interpret Answers
###RTFM and STFW: How To Tell You've Seriously Screwed Up
You shouldn't be offended by this; by hacker standards, your respondent is showing you a rough kind of respect simply by not ignoring you. You should instead be thankful for this grandmotherly kindness.

###If you don't understand...
If you don't understand the answer, do not immediately bounce back a demand for clarification. Use the same tools that you used to try and answer your original question (manuals, FAQs, the Web, skilled friends) to understand the answer. Then, if you still need to ask for clarification, exhibit what you have learned.

###Dealing with rudeness
it's the product of the direct, cut-through-the-bullshit communications style that is natural to people who are more concerned about solving problems than making others feel warm and fuzzy.

##On Not Reacting Like A Loser
##Questions Not To Ask

Here are some classic stupid questions, and what hackers are thinking when they don't answer them.

Q: Where can I find program or resource X?
Q: How can I use X to do Y?
Q: How can I configure my shell prompt?
Q: Can I convert an AcmeCorp document into a TeX file using the Bass-o-matic file converter?
Q: My {program, configuration, SQL statement} doesn't work
Q: I'm having problems with my Windows machine. Can you help?
Q: My program doesn't work. I think system facility X is broken.
Q: I'm having problems installing Linux or X. Can you help?
Q: How can I crack root/steal channel-ops privileges/read someone's e-mail?


Q:

How can I use X to do Y?

A:

If what you want is to do Y, you should ask that question without pre-supposing the use of a method that may not be appropriate. Questions of this form often indicate a person who is not merely ignorant about X, but confused about what problem Y they are solving and too fixated on the details of their particular situation. It is generally best to ignore such people until they define their problem better.

##Good and Bad Questions
By asking the question in the way I did, I gave people something to chew on; I made it easy and attractive for them to get involved. I demonstrated respect for my peers' ability and invited them to consult with me as a peer. I also demonstrated respect for the value of their time by telling them the blind alleys I had already run down.

##If You Can't Get An Answer
##How To Answer Questions in a Helpful Way
* Be gentle. 
* If you don't know for sure, say so! 
* If you can't help, don't hinder. 
* Ask probing questions to elicit more details.
* If you're going to answer the question at all, give good value. 
* Suggest good tools. Reframe the question.
* Help your community learn from the question. 
* If you did research to answer the question, demonstrate your skills rather than writing as though you pulled the answer out of your butt. Answering one good question is like feeding a hungry person one meal, but teaching them research skills by example is showing them how to grow food for a lifetime.
