听说，把悲伤和愤怒，写下来，多少能起到一些平复心情的作用；而记录的幸福时刻的一些小细节、小想法，在之后看到，也仍能让人不觉莞尔。能用心用笔头记录人生的人，有 ta 的幸福，也有 ta 的悲伤，多了一些可追溯的记忆：幸福抑或不幸。

书里 A-Z 的词典式分布，是我曾经想要做过的尝试，而后也仅止于被封藏的前三篇。或许某天，它们和之后的它们，会出来的。

以下英文，皆为原文摘录，详细内容请看书「The Lover's Dictionary」P.S.  英文阅读严重退化 真该好好看看书或字典了。

* alfresco, adv.

You fell quiet, gestured for me to listen. The sound of the woods, the feel of the air. The wine settling in my thoughts. The sky, so present. And you, watching me take it all in.
Naked to the world. The world, naked to us.

* anthem, n.

There was a pause. I was still scared by every gap in our conversation, fearing that this was it, the point where we had nothing left to say. I was still trying to impress you, and I still wanted to be impressed by you.

* ardent, adj.

Sometimes desire is air; sometimes desire is liquid. And every now and then, when everything else is air and liquid, desire solidifies, and the body is the magnet that draws its weight.

* basis, n.
* 
There has to be a moment at the beginning when you wonder whether you’re in love with the person or in love with the feeling of love itself.
If the moment doesn’t pass, that’s it —– you’re done.
And if the moment does pass, it never goes that far. It stands in the distance, ready for whenever you want it back. Sometimes it’s even there when you thought you were searching for something else, like an escape route, or your lover’s face.

* beguile, v.

But I have to tell you: I like it most like this, haphazard, sleep-strewn, disarrayed.

* bolster, v.

I am very careful whenever I know you’re on the phone with your father. I know you’ll come to me eventually, and we’ll talk you through it. But I have to wait — you need your time. In the meantime, I’m careful what songs I play. I try to speak to you with my selections.

* cache, n.

But then I heard you behind me, heard you ask:
“What’s in the folder?”
I’m sure I blushed when I told you they were printouts of your emails, with letters and notes from you pressed between them, like flowers in a dictionary.
You didn’t say anything more, and I was grateful.

* cadence, n.

I have never lived anywhere but New York or New England, but there are times when I’m talking to you and I hit a Southern vowel, or a word gets caught in a Southern truncation, and I know it’s because I’m swimming in your cadences, that you permeate my very language.

* cajole, v.

What did it matter to me? Did I think that by making you rational about one thing, I could make you rational about everything?
Maybe. Or maybe I just wanted to save you from your fears.

* champagne, n.

there’s no better way of starting a celebration than opening a bottle of champagne. Every time you sip it, you’re sipping from all those other celebrations. The joy accumulates over time.”

You pop the cork. The bubbles rise. I feel some of the spray on my skin. You pour.
“But why?” I ask as you hand me my glass.
You raise yours and ask, “Why not? What better way to start the day?”
We drink a toast to that.

* daunting, adj.

You daunted me, and I daunted you. Or would it be that I was daunted by you, and you were daunted by me? That sounds better. 

The key is to never recognize these imbalances. To not let the dauntingness daunt us.

* deadlock，n.

Even if neither of us got what we wanted, we found freedom in the third choices.

* detachment, n.

You can be separate from a thing and still care about it. If I wanted to detach completely, I would move my body away. I would stop the conversation midsentence. I would leave the bed. Instead, I hover over it for a second. I glance off in another direction. But I always glance back at you.

* dumbfounded, adj.

And still, for all the jealousy, all the doubt, sometimes I will be struck with a kind of awe that we’re together. 

I wouldn’t believe it had happened until it had happened again. Then, later on, I would be overwhelmed by the evidence, by all the lines connecting you to me, and us to love.

* ephemeral, adj.

I was coming back from the bathroom. You had just checked your email. I was walking to bed, but you intercepted me, kissed me, then clasped my left hand in your right hand and put your left hand on my back. We started slow-dancing. No music, just nighttime. You leaned your head into mine and I leaned my head into yours. Dancing cheek to cheek. Revolving slowly, eyes closed, heartbeat measure, nature’s hum. It lasted the length of an old song, and then we stopped, kissed, and the world resumed.

* ethereal, adj.

You leaned your head into mine, and I leaned my head into yours. Dancing cheek to cheek. Revolving slowly, eyes closed, heartbeat measure, nature’s hum. It lasted the length of an old song, and then we stopped, kissed, and my heart stayed there, just like that.

* fraught, adj.

Does every “I love you” deserve an “I love you too”? Does every kiss deserve a kiss back? Does every night deserve to be spent on a lover?
If the answer to any of these is “No,” what do we do?

* gingerly, adj.

You leave the phone on beside you as you fall asleep. I sit in my bed and listen to your breathing, until I know you are safe, until I know you no longer need me for the night.

* guise, n.

You were right. I am completely unposed, completely genuine. In my mind’s eye, I picture myself like that, reacting to you.

* healthy, adj.

There are times when I’m alone that I think, This is it. This is actually the natural state. All I need are my thoughts and my small acts of creation and my ability to go or do whatever I want to go or do. I am myself, and that is the point. Pairing is a social construction. It is by no means necessary for everyone to do it. Maybe I’m better like this. Maybe I could live my life in my own world, and then simply leave it when it’s time to go.

* hubris, n.

Every time I call you mine, I feel like I’m forcing it, as if saying it can make it so. As if I’m reminding you, and reminding the universe: mine. As if that one word from me could have that kind of power.

* imperceptible, adj.

We stopped counting our relationship in dates (first date, second date, fifth date, seventh) and started counting it in months. That might have been the first true commitment, this shift in terminology. We never talked about it, but we were at a party and someone asked how long we’d been together, and when you said, “A month and a half,” I knew we had gotten there.

* latitude, n.

What a strange phrase — – *not seeing other people*. As if it’s been constructed to be a lie. We see other people all the time. The question is what we do about it.

* obstinate, adj.

Sometimes it becomes a contest: Which is more stubborn, the love or the two arguing people caught within it?

* only, adj.

That’s the dilemma, isn’t it? When you’re single, there’s the sadness and joy of *only me*. And when you’re paired, there’s the sadness and joy of *only you*.

* posterity, n.

I try not to think about us growing old together, mostly because I try not to think about growing old at all. Both things — the years passing, the years together — are too enormous to contemplate. But one morning, I gave in. You were asleep, and I imagined you older and older. Your hair graying, your skin folded and creased, your breath catching. And I found myself thinking: If this continues, if this goes on, then when I die, your memories of me will be my greatest accomplishment. Your memories will be my most lasting impression.

* reservation, n.

There are times when I worry that I’ve already lost myself. That is, that my self is so inseparable from being with you that if we were to separate, I would no longer be. I save this thought for when I feel the darkest discontent. I never meant to depend so much on someone else.

* stanchion, n.

I don’t want to be the strong one, but I don’t want to be the weak one, either. Why does it feel like it’s always one or the other? When we embrace, one of us is always holding the other a little tighter.

* suffuse, v.

I don’t like it when you use my shampoo, because then your hair smells like me, not you.

* tenet, n.

At the end of the French movie, the lover sings, “Love me less, but love me for a long time.”

* transient, adj.

I realize: You have become the marker. This is your era. And it’s only if it goes on and on that I will have to look for other ways to identify the time.

* traverse, v.

You started to cry, and I quickly said, “No — I mean this part is over. We have to get to the next part.”
And you said, “I’m not sure we can.”
Without even having to think about it, I replied, “Of course we can.”
“How can you be so sure?” you asked.
And I said, “I’m sure. Isn’t that enough?”

* trenchant, adj.

You never let things go unanswered for too long. Emails. Phone calls. Questions. As if you know the waiting is the hardest part for me.

* yesterday, n.

You called to ask me when I was coming home, and when I reminded you that I wasn’t coming home, you sounded so disappointed that I decided to come home.

* Zenith

Is this the zenith? This last moment of ignorance?

End.
